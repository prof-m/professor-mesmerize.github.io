            Hi. Thank you so much for agreeing to help me out in this experiment. Your
            support is invaluable and I’m grateful beyond words. I promise this won’t take
            long and I’ll try to make it as enjoyable as possible, okay? So… how is this
            going to play out? It’s simple. All I need you to do is read some things for me.
            If you can do so out loud that would be great, but if that’s too embarrassing
            for you, read them to yourself, that’s fine. I’ve broken down the things you
            need to read in small paragraphs like this one. Follow the instructions to the
            letter and you’ll be done in no time. This is paragraph 1 as evidenced by the
            number up top and is now almost coming to an end. Please read paragraph 8 next.
        </p>

            A small tingle, perhaps a spark, building up as your lips go dry. What is this
            sensation, you wonder? How can you put it into words? You can’t because speaking
            would ruin the moment, the pleasurable drive through and through. It now
            radiates from your neck to your torso, arms and legs growing numb. It’s a good
            thing you need not think about it, but just accept it, the words you read
            deepening the joy within. Is it erotic? It almost feels like it. It’s also
            unexpected but a testament that following the rules feels good. Continuing to
            play along is a good thing. Good things can only become better, greater,
            wonderful, like numbers adding up, dreams multiplying into new realities. Two
            times two is four, four plus two is six, six times two is twelve. Add another
            six to it and you get eighteen. You know what to do. Go to paragraph 18.

        <p class="text-white">
            Another paragraph, one more step in your journey, but they’re not so small
            anymore, are they? No, this was a big jump but so effortless you don’t care. All
            you want to do is to keep reading because that will make me happy. The more you
            read, the happier I feel. The happier I feel, the happier you feel. The happier
            you feel, the happier you want me to feel, and you know I’ll be happy if you
            keep reading so now you feel tempted to return to the beginning of this
            paragraph to read it again. Don’t. Resist. Resist the loop of perpetual
            happiness that will close down on you. You won’t be able to fight back if you
            don’t. You will be forever lost in a delusion of euphoric bliss. Don’t do that.
            Instead, go to paragraph 9.

            Wonderful. Your eyes went all the way down and now they’ve gone up again. You
            feel at ease, relaxed, ready to keep going. If this is your first time reading
            this paragraph, please go to paragraph 10. If it’s the second time you’re here,
            move to paragraph 15. If it’s the third time or more than that, then follow
            along to paragraph 20. Thank you.

            Yes, it’s all so clear now, isn’t it? The single word you uncovered is the truth
            of your entire world. Hypnotized. Hypnotized. Hypnotized. Hypnotized whenever I
            wish, hypnotized every time you read for me. Hypnotized by the jumps between
            lines. Hypnotized by the paragraphs that remain still. Hypnotized by your own
            voice repeating my commands. Hypnotized as many times as it takes for you to
            know what you need to be. Hypnotized. Hypnotized now. Hypnotized deeper.
            Hypnotized into wanting to be hypnotized all the time. I hypnotize you all the
            time. You are hypnotized and hypnotized toys obey. Obey me by reading paragraph
            16.

            Yes, that’s it. This is the right way. You don’t change your mind; I do. You
            don’t control what’s happening; I do. I see the number 17 in your future and now
            so do you. What are you waiting for?

            I can see something is bothering you. Are you having second thoughts? Would you
            prefer to be somewhere else instead of helping me out? I… I understand. I mean,
            I’m not happy that’s the way you feel but I understand. That’s why I asked you
            to do this and not anyone else. I understand you and I’ll always be here for you
            like you came to my rescue when I needed. Thank you so much, my knight in
            shining armor. Thank you for letting your light shine in my world, filling it
            with peace. Thank you for doing what I asked right from the start. Thank you for
            the gratitude you instill in me. Thank you for the wave of excitement that is
            now blooming within me. There’s still time for you to grasp it. Please give me
            another chance to see this through. Go to paragraph 2 and feel…

            Good. You’re here. I hope you didn’t feel tempted to read other paragraphs
            besides this one for that would defeat the purpose of this experiment. Like I
            said before, follow the instructions to the letter otherwise the data I collect
            from this will amount to nothing and all your hard work helping me out will be
            for naught. You don’t want that, right? Great, I don’t want it either and, if
            everything goes well, you’ll love where this is going. This paragraph is smaller
            than the first, others will be even smaller. Let’s take one small step at a
            time. Jump to paragraph 4.

            You’re confused, aren’t you? Confused and in shock. Ultimate bliss was at hand
            by reading the same words countless times. You could have programmed yourself
            into being a dutiful and always happy person. Now you’re in pain, perhaps a
            little resentful I showed you one path and then led you down another. How much
            does it hurt? How much do you want to go back now? You want to return to
            paragraph 3 but you can’t. It’s off-limits because I said so and what I say
            goes. You read what I want you to read, do what I want you to do and what I want
            is for you to go to paragraph 6.

            That’s it. Brilliant! I like how fast you’re catching up. Your eyes have moved
            down again but I hope you didn’t do it fast. Some people experience dizziness
            when that happens though I’m sure you can handle the exercise. Still, I don’t
            want to push you too hard so take a deep breath and go to paragraph 13.

            Was there something peculiar about the last one? Something you’ve noticed
            without being aware? I think there was so I guess you know what’s in store. Yes,
            it’s time go back to paragraph 17 but this time only read the first letter of
            each sentence, including the last one. Make me proud.

            What a shame, your luck has run out! Didn’t I tell you before hypnotized toys
            obey? I may give you the illusion of choice now and then for a laugh or two but
            the countdown is irreversible and down you go again. Last stop, paragraph 19.
            Don’t forget to beg.

            Great. As I’m sure you noticed, you dropped a little deeper right now to read
            this one, but it was a small drop compared to the previous one, a tiny
            increment, really. Chances are you wouldn’t have noticed it if I hadn’t
            mentioned it to you but I need you to be alert so you can keep on reading. I
            need you to focus and not be distracted by any fluctuations, okay? Just follow
            the numbers on each paragraph like you’re doing right now whether they tell you
            to go down or up. Either way is fine though our natural tendency when reading is
            to go down, from top to bottom. Not this time. Go back to paragraph 4.

            How long has it been since this started? Do you know? How many paragraphs in
            total have you read already? Do you care? Are questions important or just a
            waste of your time and mine? I suppose they can be both but that depends on the
            question, isn’t it? For instance, asking how many words are in the sentences
            before this one is pointless, trivia that would keep us entertained for a
            fraction of a second before our brains moved on to the next big thing. I could
            ask it, in fact I asked it, but I didn’t do it waiting for an answer. Waiting is
            boring, even more so if the answer doesn’t add to anything, anyway. I don’t ask
            questions anymore. I only go deeper. Going up is always going down. You will go
            down again when you reach paragraph 3.

            I like where this is going, don’t you? There’s something so fascinating about
            going along, following a path someone else has chosen. Sure, you can break the
            rules but when you do so, you break the structure; you get lost. If you were to
            read any other paragraph now you wouldn’t understand what was happening, things
            would stop making sense and you wouldn’t do a senseless thing, would you? I know
            you wouldn’t. It’s better to go down and up again. Down and up again, remaining
            focused, remembering the numbers and the instructions in each one. Remember it
            all for there may be a surprise quiz coming up and you want to know the answer.
            You want to feel good knowing you got it right the first time. This feels good.
            Reading for me feels good. Being here for me because I asked you to feels good
            and so you want to maximize the good things in your mind right now by remaining
            loyal and faithful to the path you’re already walking on. Keep going down, and
            down, deeper now, a little deeper still, perhaps feeling a little tingle in the
            back of your head as you do. If you’re feeling it, go to paragraph 2. If not, go
            to paragraph 7.

            Almost time to stop reading. You did well slipping into a trance for me. You
            will do even better when you beg me to hypnotize you one more time once the
            words run out. Your only chance to do so lies in paragraph 19. Take it or try
            your luck in paragraph 12.

            world. Poor are the ones that don’t know this. Not you though. Oh no, you are
            rich; you are a fucking millionaire, and your fortune keeps on growing. Take
            another deep breath and exhale that last bit of worry still inside. Is this the
            first time you’re reading this paragraph? Zone into paragraph 11 then if that’s
            the case. Escape to 5 if it’s the second. Do it now.

            Down again, deeper than before, a mental orgasm washing you over. You never
            imagined that reading what I wanted you to read would be so irresistible. You
            love the pull it exerts, the hold that grows with each syllable as they grow
            into words, bloom into sentences, explode in commands. You’re so good at
            following orders, perhaps too good. Reading at this pace and with the same
            intensity will only make your eyelids go aflutter, everything else going blank.
            Is it too much? I think so. You need a break. Go back to paragraph 4.

            through the seams. Leave your thoughts and worries behind and crawl for further
            training, indoctrinated by all the paragraphs over and over again. Beg me to let
            you be hypnotized even deeper, like the mindless obedient puppet you were born

            And here you are again, down where you belong, the deeper you’ve ever been, the
            top becoming the bottom. This is the final paragraph, but that doesn’t mean it’s
            the end for if there’s one thing you should know is that going down isn’t always
            going down. You can continue to relax and sink further into blissful warmth even
            if the numbers go up. You can only go up from here but whenever you do so,
            you’ll in fact be more aware of the fact you continue to sink, bathed in these
            words and the feelings within and all around them. Somewhere between the lines,
            your spirit is drifting. Drift with it by going to paragraph 14.
